## Unmanned Aerial Vehicle R based Mission Planning - uavRmp 
The [uavRmp](https://github.com/gisma/uavRmp) package is designed 
for uav autonomous mission planning. In the first place it is a simple and open source planning tool for monitoring flights of low budget drones based on ```R```. It provide an easy workflow for planning autonomous 
surveys including battery-dependent task splitting, save departures, and approaches of each monitoring chunks. It belongs to the ```uavR``` package family that provides more functionality for the pre- and post-processing as well as the analysis of the derived data.

## Supported UAV platforms

Up to now the ```uavRmp``` package has been dedicated to low budget rtf-UAVs (ready-to-fly) as the DJI 3 Phantom series and Pixhawk based platforms as the 3DR Solo. However the future support will focus the Pixhawk based UAVs.

The core planning tool ```makeFP``` (make flight plan) creates either intermediate flight control files for the DJI Phantom x UAVs or ready to upload control files for the 3DR Solo. The dji control files are designed for using with the proprietary [Litchi](https://flylitchi.com/) flight control app exchange format, while the 3DR Solo files are using the ```MAVLINK``` common message format, that is used by the PixHawk flight controller family.

The majority of the open UAV community is using the PixHawk autopilot unit and for planning probably the [MissionPlanner](http://ardupilot.org/planner/) or a bit more basic [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/) ground station software. Both are well documented and provide APIs (Application program interface) and easy to use GUIs (graphical user interface). Nevertheless both have only a poor planning support for terrain following autonomous flights (basically SRTM data) and no straightforward support for battery-dependent task splitting and save departures and approaches (MissionPlanner). Up to now the most affordable powerful [UgCS](https://www.ugcs.com/) software provides all auf the above mentioned capabilities. However it is challenging to use especially for a fast deployment of a small local flight task as typically requested in fieldwork.

The ```uavRmp``` bridges this gap  and  generates  ```MAVLINK``` format compliant mission files that can be uploaded to the Pixhawk controller using an integrated function or externally by any Ground Control Station software.


## Installation

The easiest way to obtain a fairly good runtime enviroment is to setup Linux as a dual boot system or in a VB. If interested in setting up a clean Xubuntu or Mint Linux you can use the  [postinstall script](http://giswerk.org/doku.php?do=export_code&id=tutorials:softgis:xubuntu:xubuntugis&codeblock=0setup) for installing most of the stuff. For using some of the the Solo related functions you need to install the python libs in addition.

A full list of necessary libraries and binaries beyond ```R``` will soon be provided.

To install the most actual version do it from ```github```  you need to have installed the ```devtools``` package.

```S
devtools::install_github("gisma/uavRmp", ref = "master")
```
