# uavRmp
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle R based Mission Planning


The [uavRmp](https://github.com/gisma/uavRmp) package is designed 
for uav autonomous mission planning. In the first place it is a simple and open source planning tool for operating flights of low budget drones based on ```R```. It provide an easy workflow for planning autonomous 
surveys including battery-dependent task splitting and save departures and approaches of each monitoring chunks.

The range is widespread from Digital Surface Models (DSM), Digital Elevation Models (DEM), orthophotos, altitude point clouds to landuse/landscape classification, NDVI forest structure classifications and so on… 

It belongs to the ```uavR``` package family that provides more functionality for the pre- and post-processing as well as the analysis of the derived data.

## Note
Warning: Take care! There are still a lot of construction zones around. This package is far beyond to be in a mature state. Please implement a double check systems while planning and performing autonomous flight missions. You will have a lot of chances to make a small mistake what may yield in a damage of your UAV or even worse in involving people, animals or non-cash assets. 

Check your risk - use parachute systems and, even if it is running like a charm, keep alert!

## Supported UAV platforms

Up to now it has been dedicated to low budget rtf-UAVs as the DJI Phantom series and the 3DR Solo. However the current and future support will cover all Pixhawk based UAVs.

The open UAV community is focused on the Pixhawk autopilot unit and the [MissionPlanner](http://ardupilot.org/planner/) or [APM Planner 2](http://ardupilot.org/planner2/) software. Both are well documented and provide APIs and easy to use GUIs. Nevertheless they are missing planning capability (APM Planner) or an terrain following autonomous flight planning tool, that is also dealing with battery-dependent task splitting and save departures and approaches (MissionPlanner) yet. Other commmerical competitors like the powerful [ugcs](https://www.ugcs.com/) software package are still lacking an advanced capability for generating smooth and save surface following flight tasks for low AGL altitudes.

The ```uavRmd``` bridges this gap and generates ```MAVLINK``` format compliant mission files that can be uploaded to the Pixhawk controller using an integrated function or externally by any Ground Control Station software.

The reason using DJI is their absolute straightforward usage. Everybody can fly with a DJI but the price to pay off is a hermetically closed system. Only the litchi app provides additionally to a cloud based mission planer an offline/standalone interface that is up to date and facilitate the upload of a CSV formatted waypoint file to control autonomous flights with the the Phantom.



## The family

The package family consists of 4 parts:

  * flight planning ```uavRmp```
  * forest analysis ```uavRfa```
  * remote sensing ```uavRrs```
  * archaeology ```uavRao```
  
## Installation
Please note that uavRmp is making strong use of CLI tools like GDAL. The setup  of the correct linkage to these APIs can be cumbersome. For using the ```uavRmp``` package you need to install the  ```link2GI``` package. Because the CRAN version is a bit outdated you should get the actual github hosted version of the [link2GI](https://github.com/gisma/link2GI/blob/master/README.md) package. 

Nevertheless all mentioned software packages have to be installed correctly on your OS. It is just in parts tested under Windows but should run... The most easiest way to obtain a fairly good runtime enviroment is to setup Linux as a dual boot system or in a VB. If interested in setting up a clean Xubuntu or Mint Linux and then use the  [postinstall script](http://giswerk.org/doku.php?do=export_code&id=tutorials:softgis:xubuntu:xubuntugis&codeblock=0setup) for installing most of the stuff. For using some of the the Pixhawk/3DR Solo related functions you need to install the [dronekit](http://python.dronekit.io/develop/installation.html) python libs in addition.

A full list of necessary libaries and binaries beyond ```R``` will soon be provided.


To install from ```github```  you need to have installed the ```devtools``` package.

```S
devtools::install_github("gisma/uavRmp", ref = "master")
```

If you want to install all dependencies use:

```S
devtools::install_github("gisma/uavRmp", ref = "master", dependencies = TRUE)
```

# Mission planning 

## Introduction

The core planning tools ```makeAP``` (make area plan) and ```makeTP``` (make target plan) are creating either intermediate flight control files for the DJI Phantom 3x UAVs or ready to upload control files for the Pixhawk based UAVs like the 3DR Solo . The intermediate DJI control files are expected to be used with the proprietary [Litchi](https://flylitchi.com/) flight control app, while the Pixhawk/3DR Solo files are using the ```MAVLINK``` common message format.

The basic idea is to provide an easy to use workflow for controlling rtf UAVs on autonomous survey missions.  

DJI: The reason using DJI UAVs is because of their absolute straightforward usage. Everybody can fly with a DJI but the price for this simplicity is a hermetically closed system. Only the Litchi app provides in addition to a cloud based mission planer an offline/standalone interface to upload a CSV formated way point file for autonomous flights to the Phantom.

PixHawk/3DR Solo: The open uav community is focused on the PixHawk autopilot unit and the Mission Planner software. It is well documented and several APIs are provided. Nevertheless a terrain following autonomous flight planning tool is not available. '''uavRst''' supports the ```MAVLINK``` common message format that can be uploaded directly on the Pixhawk controller using Ground Control Station software or the ```upload2Solo``` function.

## The types of mission tasks
 
To define a flight area you have to provide either 4 Points (or 3 lines). You may take more complex vectors like a multi point polygon, but only the first 4 coordinates x1, x2, x3 and x4 (the latter for the launching position) are used in exactly this order. If you take a rectangle the 4th corner coordinate will be the launching point. The concept is looking like the following sketch:
    
    x2------x3           x2-------x1
    | a                 /
    |                  /
    |   x4            / x4
    |  /             / /
    x1/             x3/
   
This coordinates, the length of the line and the angle are used to calculate extend and parallels of the flight plan according to the flight altitude, overlap etc. NOTE: The flight direction depends on the order of the points. 

If ```flightPlanMode = "tracks"```. The result look like below.

    #--#  #-->             #-----#
    |  |  |               /    
    |  |  |              #-----#
    |  |  |                   /
    #  #--#         <--#-----#

   
If ```flightPlanMode = "waypoints"``` the result is an equal spatial distribution of way points:
 
    #--#  #-->             #--#--#
    |  |  |               /    
    #  #  #              #--#--#
    |  |  |                   /
    #  #--#         <--#--#--#
    
 
 
```waypoints``` is optimal for autonomous flights under calm conditions in complex terrain because the camera takes a picture at every way point.

```track``` is optimal for relatively plain areas and automatically triggered picture capturing 
 DJI only: Automatically picture capturing in a time interval works only within the range of the remote control because the uav needs a trigger signal for taking pictures.
 
## Terrain following task

 The argument ```followSurface = TRUE``` will switch from fixed AGL flight altitude into a terrain following flight altitude.

NOTE: You have to be aware that the DJI uav is calibrating the altitude at the launch position in the field! So you need either a correct coordinate altitude or a high resolution DEM to get a good(!) estimation of the launch position and altitude.
 
You must choose a clearly defined and reliable launching position both in the map and the field. If you fail I made the experience that the aircraft probably will hit the terrain...

 
Let us assume a defined flight altitude of 50m. According to the launching point altitude the uav will act like the following sketch shows:
 
  
 
     ............... x_(uav)_x ........... uav started at 30 m altitude results in
                                             a "real" flight altitude of 30m + 50m => 80m
 
 
                    ___60m____
                   |          |
           30m _x__|          |
          ____|               |___
      ___|                        |____

 
 
                   ___60m____
        ..........|          |............ uav started at 0 m altitude results in
               ___|          |___          "real" flight altitude of 50m above 0m
          ____|                  |
      ___|                       |__x__ 0m


To avoid negative impacts from the Phantom 3 auto-calibration, the launch altitude is used to correct the flight altitude according to:

 
     maximumAltitude_of_surveyArea + altitude_of_launchposition
   
So the adapted flight altitude is always seen as the flight altitude above the highest terrain altitude:

 
     ...................................... real altitude of uav 110 m
      
      
                   ___60m____
                  |          |
           30m _x_|          |___
          ____|                  |
      ___|                       |______


To get a fixed scale flight the launch altitude is used to correct the flight altitude according to:

     ```maximumAltitude of surveyArea + altitude of launch position```

With the setting of ```terrainfollowing = true``` this is calculated for each way point. So the adapted flight altitude looks like this:

 
                   ..........
                  |          |
              ....|          |....
         ....|     ___60m____    |
    ....|         |          |   |....... real altitude of uav 50m
           30m _x_|          |___
          ____|                  |
      ___|                       |___x___ 0m


# Mission Planning Tutorial

## Overview of the task

This recipe deals with the effective and safe planning of an autonomous flight. This provides basic information about the used hardware and software as well as supplemental data and nice to haves.

## Skills you will learn 

The basic workflow of planning a good aerial and target oriented flight mission. In the extended version you find some more explanations and hints for improving your planning. 

Even if you can assume the use of uavs for autonomous flights as somehow “operational”, you should always keep in mind that avoiding negative impacts is a result of ￼responsible and focused planning.

     Please keep in mind that autonomous UAVs can harm the the pilot and environment. 

## Things you need 

  - [R](https://www.r-project.org) 
  - [uavRmp](https://github.com/gisma/uavRmp) package
  - Digital Surface Model  (DSM) data 
  - DJI Phantom/Pixhawk UAV
  - For DJI only [Litchi](https://flylitchi.com/) flight App    
  - For Pixhawk [droidPlanner 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.droidplanner&hl=de)
  - Time to work it out

## General Workflow 


  - Identify the area, digitize/type the coords of 3 corners and the launching position
  - Adjust the flight parameters to your needs and generate flight control files
  - Convert and upload the mission control files either directly to your tablet/smartphone or alternatively via the Litchi cloud.
  - Make an extensive preflight check
  - Fly the mission
  
Training examples =====


The first example will introduce you to the basic usage and folder structure.

## Basic Example Phantom 3
 

     Purpose: Survey flight over flat terrain to generate DSM and orthophoto. It is described for the Phantom3 and Litchi only. 

Addressed issues:

  - Create a reliable DSM for near surface retrieval of high resolution pictures
  - Create an orthophoto for visual inspection of POIs

## The short way 

Digitize the 3 corner points of an area you want to map and  in addition as fourth point the position of the planned uav launch.  Save it to  //firstSurvey.kml//. 

```{R, eval=FALSE}
 library(uavRmp)

 # preset = "uav" supress all not necessary tools
 vecDraw(mapCenter = c(50.855,8.691),preset="uav")

 # Use the digitized data and the example DEM to calculate a flight control file
 fp <- makeAP(projectDir = "~/proj",
              locationName = "valleyWood",
              surveyArea = "firstSurvey.kml",
              flightAltitude = 100,
              demFn = data(mrbiko))
```

Note: The first two points determine the flight angle and direction the second and third coordinate determine the width of the area. 

If you want so save it on your SD card, open the [Litchi Mission](https://flylitchi.com/hub|Litchi Mission) website and click on the button ```Missions->Import```. Next navigate to the control file ```firstsurvey_1001.csv``` (you’ll find it in the folder ```~/projectDir/mission/date/control```). For exporting it choose ```Missions->Save``` and navigate/upload it to your missions subfolder of the Litchi app. That’s it.

Even more simple is the option to connect with the litchi cloud. While you are logged in with the same account it is synchronizing the data as soon as you start the litchi app.

## The long way


### Digitizing of the survey area

We want to plan a flight in a more or less flat terrain in the upper Lahn-valley. First load the libraries and next start the small digitizing tool that is provided in ''uavRmp''. 

    You may take any other tool to digitize the survey area as well as you may type the coordinates on Stdin.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# load uavRmp
library(uavRmp)

# start digitizing tool with preset = "uav" for a reduced toolbar
# see ?leafDraw for more information
vecDraw(mapCenter = c(50.855,8.691),preset="uav")
```
