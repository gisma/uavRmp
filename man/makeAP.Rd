\description{
The basic idea is to provide an easy to use workflow for controlling rtf-UAVs for planning autonomous surveys to retrieve aerial data sets.
}
\details{
makeAP (make aerial plan) creates either intermediate flight control files for the
DJI phantom x UAVs or ready to upload control files for the 3DR Solo/PixHawk flight controller. The
DJI control files are designed for using with the proprietary litchi flight
control app exchange format, while the 3DR Solo/PixHawk flight controller files are using the MAVLINK
common message set, that is used by the PixHawk flight controller family.
Both are implemented very rudimentary.\cr\cr DJI:\cr The reason using DJI
is their absolute straightforward usage. Everybody can fly with a DJI but
the price is a more or less closed system at least in the low budget segment. There are workarounds like the litchi app that provides
additionally to a cloud based mission planner an offline/standalone
interface to upload a CSV formatted way point file for autonomous flights to
the Phantom.\cr\cr PixHawk flight controller/3DR Solo:\cr The open UAV community is focused
on the PixHawk autopilot unit and the Mission Planner software. It is well
documented and several APIs are provided. Nevertheless a high resolution
terrain following flight planning tool for  autonomous obstacle avoiding flight missions
is not available. \code{makeAP} creates a straightforward version of MAV format flight control
rules that are ready to be uploaded directly on the Pixhawk controller using the \code{solo_upload} function.\cr\cr

\section{Warning}{
 Take care! There are still a lot of construction zones
around. This script is far beyond to be in a mature state. Please control
and backup all controls again while planning and performing autonomous
flight plans and missions. You will have a lot of chances to make a small
mistake what may yield in a damage of your UAV or even worse in involving
people, animals or non-cash assets. Check your risk, use parachute systems
and even if it is running like a charm, keep alert!
